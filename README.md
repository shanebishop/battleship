# battleship
A simple 2D graphical implementation of the classic Battleship game

As stated above, this is a simple 2D graphical implementation of the classic Battleship game. This program is based primarily on two classes, Battleship2 and AIShip, both written in Java. It also uses four JPEGs.

Next steps:
- The user can currently place ships on top each other
- The user cannot rotate the ships yet
- The user cannot attack
- The AI cannot attack
- The program does not check for game over
